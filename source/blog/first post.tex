###

This is the first post in ergo-cms. 

This page, because it exists in the @blog@ folder, will have the @post.html@ layout applied to it. You can see the configuration for this in @config.ergo.js@. This is completely arbitary, of course. If this file is moved elsewhere, then it will revert to using the default post type, @page@, which uses the @page.html@ layout. Note that the main homepage (@/index.tex@) uses the @homepage.html@ layout as a special layout.

Both @page.html@ and @post.html@ can be found in the @_layouts@ folder of the current theme (eg @_themes/default/_layouts@) and have the same basic structure:

{{=[[ ]]=}}

bc. {{> header.inc.html}}
{{{content}}}
{{> footer.inc.html}}

Happy blogging!
