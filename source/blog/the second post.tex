This is the first post in ergo-cms. This was written in textile. It is the second post, because of the date. As indicated in the "first post":/blog/a-first-ost.html, the header is now slightly different.

The good thing about textile, is that in general, it's a lot easier to be more creative in styling, without needing to drop completely to html (which you can still do, of course). If you'd like to see more, then visit "$":https://txstyle.org/.
