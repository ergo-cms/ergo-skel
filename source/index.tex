h1. Welcome

If you are reading this for the first time, then welcome to ergo-cms. Your first step to understanding where to get started will be to browse these files in a explorer/finder window. 

If you are not yet viewing this page in a browser window, then perhaps you'd care to try running:

code. ergo view

If you didn't install ergo globally, that's ok. Try running this instead:

code. npm run view


Now you may open your browser (as indicated in the command line) at "$":http://localhost:8181. To be taken to the 'live' version of this page.

Then, when you're ready to launch, go the "first blog post":/blog/a-first-post.html.

You may also care to check out the "bootstrap":http://getbootstrap.com/ version of these files, to show how adaptable this all is. Simply download or clone from: "$":https://github.com/ergo-cms/ergo-skel-bootstrap and then 'npm run view' as before.
